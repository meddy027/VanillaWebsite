                    <p>My name is Malik Eddy and I want to become a software engineer. I am 28 years old, have a BS in Computer Science from CSU, East Bay, and live in the Bay Area.</p>

                    <p>You may be wondering why I put "Project 1/100", well that is because I feel that in order to gain a software developer position, with a focus in full-stack development, I need to begin somewhere and this is it. Moreso, I believe that by doing 100 front-end and/or full-stack projects, I will gain the skills needed to be successful in this area.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>I grew up in the Bay Area. When I was younger, I wanted to play professional sports, either baseball or basketball. Fast forward to senior year in high school, I decide to play baseball and we win the championship. I go on to college with computer science not even a figment of my imagination. Come 2 years down the road in college, I did not make the team and started looking for a new career path. My dad recommends I change my major from business marketing to CS/IT. I listen and thus starts my journey to becoming a software developer.</p>
